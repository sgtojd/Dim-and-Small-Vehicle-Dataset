# Dim-and-Small-Vehicle-Dataset
We build the dim and small vehicle dataset (DSVD) to evaluate the small object detection performance in remote sensing scenes. 

## Dataset Description
For the picked images up to 3225, we labeled the vehicles thoroughly using the rectangular bounding box. 2257 images are randomly chosen from the whole images for the network training, and the other 968 images are the test data for network perfor-mance evaluation. The constructed small object dataset has the following detection difficulties:

•	The vehicles with relatively monotonic appearance are small in size, dim in fea-tures, and low in contrast.

•	The image covers a wide area and various complex scenes, such as parking lots, roads, neighborhoods, etc.

## Dataset Resource
The dataset is avaliable on the link  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1HKBFrgTNDsOInnK0w6qyOg. The extration password is _tcjr_. And the decompression password is _dimandsmallvehicle_.  If you want use our dataset, please follows these rules:

• All images and their associated annotations in DSVD can be used for academic purposes only, but any commercial use is prohibited.

• If you need to use our dataset to make research, please cite our essay.
